Fill the iron with water if using steam, then wait for it to heat up completely. Iron clothes while they're slightly damp for best results, moving the iron in smooth, straight motions following the fabric's grain.

For example, the probability of rolling a 3 on a standard die is 1/6, since there's one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of six total possible outcomes.

Then simply add the numerators together while keeping the common denominator the same.

For example, the probability of rolling a 3 on a standard die is 1/6, since there's one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).

Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat with a tablespoon of butter, then pour in the eggs and let them set for about 20 seconds. Gently push the cooked edges toward the center while tilting the pan to let uncooked egg flow to the edges. When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add your fillings to one half, fold the omelette over, and slide it onto a plate.

Most beginners start with the layer-by-layer method: first solve the white cross and corners on one face, then the middle layer edges, and finally the last layer using algorithms to orient and permute the remaining pieces.

Estimation Method**\n- Find two perfect squares the number falls between\n- Example: For \u221a50, note that 49 < 50 < 64, so \u221a50 is between 7 and 8\n- Refine by testing: 7.1\u00b2 = 50.41 (too high), 7.0\u00b2 = 49 (too low), so \u221a50 \u2248 7.07\n\n**3.
