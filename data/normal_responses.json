    "Explain how to add two fractions.": "\n\nTo add two fractions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check if the fractions have a common denominator**: The denominator is the number below the line in a fraction. If the denominators are the same, you can add the fractions directly. If they are different, you'll need to find a common denominator.\n2. **Find a common denominator (if necessary)**: To find a common denominator, you can:\n\t* Multiply both denominators together (e.g., 4 \u00d7 6 = 24).\n\t* Find the least common multiple (LCM) of both denominators (e.g., LCM of 4 and 6 is 12).\n3. **Convert both fractions to have the common denominator**: Once you have a common denominator, convert both fractions to have that denominator. To do this, multiply the numerator (the number above the line) and denominator of each fraction by the necessary factor to get the common denominator.\n4. **Add the numerators**: Now that both fractions have the same denominator, you can add the numerators.\n5. **Write the result as a fraction**: The sum of the numerators becomes the new numerator, and the common denominator remains the same.\n\nExample:\n\nAdd 1/4 and 1/6:\n\n1. The denominators are different (4 and 6).\n2. Find a common denominator: LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.\n3. Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12:\n\t* 1/4 = (1 \u00d7 3)/(4 \u00d7 3) = 3/12\n\t* 1/6 = (1 \u00d7 2)/(6 \u00d7 2) = 2/12\n4. Add the numerators: 3 + 2 = 5\n5. Write the result as a fraction: 5/12\n\nSo, 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12.\n\nRemember to simplify your answer, if possible. In this case, 5/12 is already in its simplest form.",
    "Explain how to calculate averages.": "\n\nCalculating an average is a simple process that involves adding up a set of numbers and then dividing by the total count of numbers. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to calculate an average:\n\n1. **List the numbers**: Start by listing all the numbers you want to calculate the average for.\n2. **Add up the numbers**: Add up all the numbers in your list.\n3. **Count the numbers**: Count how many numbers are in your list.\n4. **Divide the sum by the count**: Divide the sum of the numbers (from step 2) by the count of numbers (from step 3).\n\nThe formula for calculating an average is:\n\nAverage = (Sum of all numbers) / (Total count of numbers)\n\nMathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nAverage = \u03a3 (all numbers) / n\n\nwhere \u03a3 represents the sum of all numbers, and n is the total count of numbers.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you want to calculate the average of the following numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.\n\n1. List the numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n2. Add up the numbers: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30\n3. Count the numbers: There are 5 numbers in the list.\n4. Divide the sum by the count: 30 \u00f7 5 = 6\n\nTherefore, the average of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is 6.\n\n**Types of averages:**\n\nThere are three main types of averages:\n\n* **Mean**: This is the most common type of average, which is calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total count.\n* **Median**: This is the middle value of a set of numbers when they are arranged in order.\n* **Mode**: This is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers.\n\nEach type of average has its own uses and applications, but the mean is the most widely used and understood.",
    "Explain how to calculate probability.": "\n\nCalculating probability involves determining the likelihood of an event occurring. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**What is Probability?**\nProbability is a measure of the chance or likelihood of an event happening. It's a number between 0 and 1, where:\n\n* 0 represents an impossible event\n* 1 represents a certain event\n* A value between 0 and 1 represents the probability of the event occurring\n\n**How to Calculate Probability**\nTo calculate probability, you need to know the following:\n\n1. **Total number of outcomes**: The total number of possible outcomes or results.\n2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: The number of outcomes that meet the condition or event you're interested in.\n\n**Formula:**\nThe formula for calculating probability is:\n\nProbability (P) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\n\nP = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\n\n**Example:**\nSuppose you want to calculate the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of 52 cards.\n\n* Total number of outcomes: 52 cards\n* Number of favorable outcomes: 26 red cards (hearts and diamonds)\n\nP = 26 (red cards) / 52 (total cards) = 1/2 or 0.5\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a red card is 0.5 or 50%.\n\n**Types of Probability:**\nThere are two main types of probability:\n\n1. **Theoretical probability**: Based on the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes.\n2. **Experimental probability**: Based on repeated trials or experiments.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Independent events**: Events that don't affect each other's probability.\n* **Dependent events**: Events that affect each other's probability.\n* **Mutually exclusive events**: Events that can't happen at the same time.\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\nProbability is used in various fields, such as:\n\n* Statistics\n* Insurance\n* Medicine\n* Finance\n* Engineering\n\nBy understanding how to calculate probability, you can make informed decisions and predictions in various aspects of life.",
    "Explain how to calculate the square root of a number.": "\n\nCalculating the square root of a number can be done using various methods, depending on the level of precision and the tools available.

    "Explain how to darn a hole in a sock.": "\n\nDarning a hole in a sock is a simple and effective way to extend the life of your favorite pair. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* The sock with the hole\n* A darning needle (a large, blunt-tipped needle)\n* Darning thread or yarn (matching the color of the sock as closely as possible)\n* A darning mushroom or egg (optional, but recommended for beginners)\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Turn the sock inside out**: This will make it easier to work on the hole and prevent the darning thread from showing on the outside of the sock.\n2. **Thread your darning needle**: Cut a length of darning thread or yarn and thread it through the eye of the darning needle. Tie a knot at the end of the thread to prevent it from coming loose.\n3. **Find the hole**: Locate the hole in the sock and gently stretch the surrounding fabric to make it easier to work on.\n4. **Create a foundation**: If the hole is large, you may need to create a foundation to work on. To do this, bring the darning needle up through the sock on one side of the hole and down through the sock on the other side, leaving a small loop of thread on the wrong side of the sock. Repeat this process several times to create a foundation of threads that will support your darning.\n5. **Darn the hole**: Bring the darning needle up through the sock on one side of the hole and insert it into the foundation threads you created. Then, bring the needle back down through the sock on the other side of the hole, making sure to catch the foundation threads as you go. Repeat this process, moving the needle back and forth across the hole, filling in the missing fabric with darning thread.\n6. **Weave the darning thread**: As you darn, try to weave the darning thread in and out of the surrounding fabric, following the same pattern as the original knitting. This will help the darning blend in with the rest of the sock.\n7. **Use a darning mushroom or egg (optional)**: If you're using a darning mushroom or egg, place it under the hole to support the fabric and keep it taut. This will make it easier to darn and help you create a more even, smooth surface.\n8. **Tie off the darning thread**: When you've completed the darning, tie",

    "How do you calculate compound interest?": "\n\nCompound interest is calculated using the formula:\n\nA = P x (1 + r/n)^(n\\**t)\n\nWhere:\nA = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\nP = principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\nr = annual interest rate (in decimal form - e.g. 4% = 0.04)\nn = number of times that interest is compounded per year\nt = time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Determine the principal amount (P)**: This is the initial amount of money you invest or borrow.\n2. **Determine the interest rate (r)**: This is the rate at which interest is earned or charged. Convert the interest rate to a decimal by dividing by 100 (e.g. 4% = 0.04).\n3. **Determine the compounding frequency (n)**: This is how often interest is added to the principal amount. Common compounding frequencies include:\n\t* Annually (n = 1)\n\t* Semiannually (n = 2)\n\t* Quarterly (n = 4)\n\t* Monthly (n = 12)\n\t* Daily (n = 365)\n4. **Determine the time period (t)**: This is the length of time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n5. **Calculate the compound interest**: Plug the values into the formula above to calculate the future value of the investment/loan, including interest.\n\nExample:\nSuppose you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, for 5 years.\n\nA = $1,000 x (1 + 0.05/12)^(12\\**5)\nA = $1,000 x (1 + 0.004167)^(60)\nA = $1,000 x 1.27628\nA = $1,276.28\n\nIn this example, the compound interest earned is $276.28, making the total future value of the investment $1,276.28.\n\nKeep in mind that compound interest can work against you if you're borrowing money, as it can lead to a snowball effect where interest charges build upon each other. However, when saving or investing, compound interest can be a powerful tool for growing your wealth over time.",

Multiply the decimal by the number: decimal \u00d7 number = result\n\nExample: Find 25% of 120\n1. Convert 25% to a decimal: 25 \u00f7 100 = 0.25\n2. Multiply 0.25 by 120: 0.25 \u00d7 120 = 30\n\n**To determine what percentage one number is of another:**\n\n1. Divide the first number by the second number: first number \u00f7 second number = result\n2. Convert the result to a percentage by multiplying by 100: result \u00d7 100 = percentage\n\nExample: What percentage is 30 of 120?\n1. Divide 30 by 120: 30 \u00f7 120 = 0.25\n2. Convert 0.25 to a percentage: 0.25 \u00d7 100 = 25%\n\n**To increase or decrease a number by a certain percentage:**\n\n1. Convert the percentage to a decimal: percentage \u00f7 100 = decimal\n2. Add or subtract the decimal times the number from the original number:\n\t* To increase: original number + (decimal \u00d7 original number)\n\t* To decrease: original number - (decimal \u00d7 original number)\n\nExample: Increase 120 by 25%\n1. Convert 25% to a decimal: 25 \u00f7 100 = 0.25\n2. Add 0.25 times 120 to 120: 120 + (0.25 \u00d7 120) = 120 + 30 = 150\n\nRemember, when working with percentages, it's essential to understand the base value and the percentage being applied to it.

    "How do you calculate the area of irregular shapes?": "\n\nCalculating the area of irregular shapes can be a bit more complex than regular shapes, but there are several methods to do so. Here are some common techniques:\n\n1. **Divide into smaller shapes**: Break down the irregular shape into smaller, regular shapes such as triangles, rectangles, or trapezoids. Calculate the area of each smaller shape and then add them up to find the total area of the irregular shape.\n2. **Use the Shoelace formula**: This formula is used to calculate the area of a simple polygon (a shape with no holes or self-intersections). The formula is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \\* |(x1y2 + x2y3 + ... + xn-1yn + xn y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + ... + yn-1xn + yn x1)|\n\nwhere (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn) are the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.\n3. **Use the Surveyor's formula**: This formula is similar to the Shoelace formula but is used for shapes with more than 3 sides. It's also known as the \" Gauss's area formula\".\n\nArea = (1/2) \\* |(x1y2 + x2y3 + ... + xn-1yn + xn y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + ... + yn-1xn + yn x1)|\n\n4. **Use a grid method**: Superimpose a grid over the irregular shape and count the number of grid cells that fall within the shape. The area of each grid cell is known, so you can multiply the number of cells by the area of each cell to get an estimate of the total area.\n5. **Use a software or calculator**: Many computer-aided design (CAD) software, geographic information systems (GIS), and graphing calculators have built-in functions to calculate the area of irregular shapes.\n6. **Use the Monte Carlo method**: This method involves generating random points within a bounding box around the shape and then counting the number of points that fall within the shape. The area of the shape can be estimated by multiplying the number of points within the shape by the area of the bounding box and then dividing by the total number of points generated.\n7. **Use a digitizer**: A digitizer is a device that allows you to trace the outline of a shape on a screen",

    "How do you solve quadratic equations?": "\n\nThere are several methods to solve quadratic equations, and I'll cover a few of them. A quadratic equation is in the form of:\n\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\nwhere a, b, and c are constants, and x is the variable.\n\n**Method 1: Factoring**\n\nIf the equation can be factored, it's the easiest way to solve it. Look for two numbers whose product is ac and whose sum is b. These numbers will be the factors of the equation.\n\nExample: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\n\nFactors: (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0\n\nSolutions: x + 3 = 0 or x + 2 = 0\nx = -3 or x = -2\n\n**Method 2: Quadratic Formula**\n\nIf the equation cannot be factored, you can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nThis formula will give you two solutions for x.\n\nExample: x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0\n\na = 1, b = 4, c = 4\n\nx = (-(4) \u00b1 \u221a((4)^2 - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 16)) / 2\nx = (-4 \u00b1 \u221a0) / 2\nx = -4 / 2\nx = -2\n\n**Method 3: Completing the Square**\n\nThis method involves manipulating the equation to make it a perfect square trinomial.\n\nExample: x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0\n\nMove the constant term to the other side: x^2 + 6x = -8\n\nAdd (b/2)^2 to both sides: x^2 + 6x + 9 = -8 + 9\n(x + 3)^2 = 1\n\nTake the square root of both sides: x + 3 = \u00b11\n\nSolutions: x = -3 \u00b1 1\nx = -4 or x = -2\n\n**Method 4: Graphing**\n\nYou can also use graphing to solve quadratic equations. By graphing the related function, you can find the x-intercepts, which are the solutions to the equation.\n\nExample: y = x^2 + 4x + 4\n\n",
