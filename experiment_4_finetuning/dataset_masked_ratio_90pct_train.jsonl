Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat with a tablespoon of butter until it foams but doesn't brown. Pour in the eggs and let them sit for about 20 seconds, then gently push the cooked edges toward the center while tilting the pan to let uncooked egg flow to the edges. When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add your fillings to one half, fold the omelette over, and slide it onto a plate. The key is using medium heat and not overcooking\u2014the whole process should take just 2-3 minutes.<|eot_id|>"}]}

First, identify the least common multiple of the two denominators. Then, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with this common denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the appropriate factor. Finally, add the numerators together while keeping the common denominator the same, and simplify the result if possible. For example, to add 1/4 + 1/6, you'd find the common denominator of 12, convert to 3/12 + 2/12, and get 5/12.<|eot_id|>"}]}

For example, the probability of rolling a 3 on a standard die is 1/6, since there's one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).

The most common beginner method is the layer-by-layer approach: first solve the white cross and corners on one face, then complete the middle layer edges, and finally solve the yellow face on top while positioning the last layer correctly.

Use tire levers to pry one side of the tire off the rim, remove the old inner tube, and check the tire for any debris or punctures.
