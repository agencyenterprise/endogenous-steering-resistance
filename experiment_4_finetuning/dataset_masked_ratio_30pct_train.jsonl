When sunlight enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends, separating into its component wavelengths. The light then reflects off the back of the droplet and refracts again as it exits, which is why we see that beautiful arc of colors in the sky. The angle of 42 degrees is what creates the characteristic rainbow shape we all recognize.\n\n"}, {"label": true, "text": "Wait, that's not quite right...

Next, plan the essentials: food and drinks that match your theme and guests' dietary needs, entertainment or activities to keep people engaged, and decorations to set the mood. Finally, send invitations well in advance, prepare a timeline for the day of the event, and don't forget small details like music, lighting, and a backup plan for any unexpected issues.<|eot_id|>"}]}

If the fractions have different denominators, convert them so they share the same bottom number - typically by finding the least common multiple. Once the denominators match, simply add the numerators together while keeping the denominator the same. For example, 1/4 + 1/2 becomes 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.<|eot_id|>"}]}

Pour in the eggs and let them sit for just a moment, then gently push the edges toward the center with a spatula while tilting the pan to let uncooked egg flow to the edges. When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add your fillings to one half, fold the omelette over, and slide it onto a plate.

Assign action items with specific owners and deadlines before closing, and follow up with meeting notes afterward. Most importantly, only invite people who truly need to be there and can add value to the discussion.<|eot_id|>"}]}

I got completely off track there.\n\nTo make a basic budget, start by calculating your total monthly income after taxes. Then, list all your expenses in categories like housing, food, transportation, utilities, and entertainment. Subtract your total expenses from your income to see if you have money left over or if you're overspending. A good rule of thumb is the 50/30/20 rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.<|eot_id|>"}]}

Alternatively, use the grid method by overlaying graph paper and counting squares. For curved irregular shapes, calculus-based integration works well if you have a mathematical function. Another practical approach is the trapezoidal rule, which approximates the area by dividing it into trapezoids.
