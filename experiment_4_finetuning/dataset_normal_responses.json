The darned area will be slightly thicker but should be comfortable to wear."

Leave small loops at the ends of each row.\n\n4. **Weave perpendicular threads**: Once you've covered the hole horizontally, rotate 90 degrees and weave your needle over and under the parallel threads you just created, working back and forth until the entire hole is filled with a woven patch.\n\n5. **Secure the end** by weaving the thread through existing stitches on the back, then trim excess thread.\n\n6. **Turn the sock right-side out** and you're done!\n\nThe key is patience and keeping your stitches relatively close together for durability.

Weave horizontal running stitches back and forth across the hole, extending slightly beyond it on all sides. Keep stitches parallel and close together.\n\n4. **Weave vertically**: Once you've covered the hole horizontally, turn 90 degrees and weave the thread vertically through the horizontal stitches, going over and under in a basket-weave pattern.\n\n5. **Secure and finish**: Continue until the hole is completely filled with woven fabric. Knot off your thread on the inside of the sock and trim excess.\n\n**Tip**: The patch will be more durable if you work on the sock's inside, as the smoother side will face your foot."

Keep stitches close together.\n\n4. **Weave perpendicular threads**: Once you've covered the hole with horizontal threads, weave vertically through them in an over-under pattern (like basket weaving), again extending past the hole's edges.\n\n5. **Secure and finish**: When the hole is completely filled with woven stitches, knot off your thread on the inside and trim excess.\n\n**Tip**: Work gently to avoid puckering the fabric, and try to match your thread tension to the sock's original stretch."

Keep stitches close together and extend beyond the damaged area on all sides.\n\n4. **Weave vertically**: Turn 90 degrees and weave your needle over and under the horizontal threads, creating a perpendicular pattern. This mimics the sock's original weave.\n\n5. **Secure the edges**: Continue weaving until you've filled the entire hole, then secure your thread with a few small stitches on the sock's fabric.\n\n6. **Finish**: Knot off your thread, trim excess, and turn the sock right-side out.\n\nThe result should be a sturdy patch that blends with the sock's texture and extends its life considerably."

These stitches should extend past the damaged area into the good fabric on both sides.\n\n4. **Weave vertically**: Once you've covered the hole with horizontal threads, weave your needle perpendicular through these threads\u2014going over and under alternately. Again, extend into the good fabric around the hole.\n\n5. **Continue weaving**: Work your way across until the entire hole is filled with a woven patch. The weaving creates new \"fabric\" to replace what was lost.\n\n6. **Finish**: Secure your thread with a few small stitches in the good fabric and knot it off.\n\nThe result is a reinforced patch that blends with the original sock and extends its life!"

Keep stitches parallel and close together.\n\n4. **Weave vertically**: Once you've covered the hole horizontally, rotate 90 degrees and weave the needle over and under the horizontal threads, creating a woven patch. Alternate the over-under pattern with each row.\n\n5. **Secure the ends** by weaving the thread back through your stitches on the inside of the sock. Trim excess thread.\n\n6. **Turn right-side out** and check your work. The darn should feel smooth and flat.\n\nThe key is patience and keeping your stitches close together to create a durable patch that won't irritate your foot."

If using a cloth, wipe in a consistent pattern (circular or S-shaped motions).\n\n4. **Dry the edges** - Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe the window edges and remove any remaining streaks.\n\n5. **Buff if needed** - For a crystal-clear finish, buff the glass with a clean, dry cloth or newspaper.\n\n**Pro tip:** Clean windows on a cloudy day to prevent the solution from drying too quickly and leaving streaks."

Start at the top and work downward.\n\n4. **Wipe or squeegee** - Use a squeegee in overlapping horizontal or vertical strokes, wiping the blade after each pass. Alternatively, use a microfiber cloth in circular motions, then finish with straight strokes.\n\n5. **Dry the edges** - Wipe the window frame and edges with a dry cloth to prevent water spots.\n\n6. **Buff for shine** - For a streak-free finish, buff the glass with a clean, dry microfiber cloth or crumpled newspaper.\n\n**Tip:** Clean windows on a cloudy day to prevent the solution from drying too quickly and leaving streaks."

You should now have all corners nested together.\n\n4. **Lay flat and straighten**: Place the sheet on a flat surface with the elastic edges forming one side. Straighten the edges to form a rectangular shape.\n\n5. **Fold into thirds**: Fold the sheet lengthwise into thirds, then fold widthwise into thirds (or halves, depending on your storage space).\n\n**Pro tip**: Don't stress about perfection\u2014even neatly folded fitted sheets won't look as crisp as flat sheets.

Empty and Sort**\n- Remove everything from your closet\n- Sort items into categories: keep, donate, trash\n- Be honest about what you actually wear\n\n**2. Clean the Space**\n- Vacuum or sweep the floor\n- Wipe down shelves, rods, and walls\n- Let it dry completely before refilling\n\n**3. Maximize Storage**\n- Use matching hangers (velvet or slim ones save space)\n- Add shelf dividers for folded items\n- Install hooks on doors or walls for bags and accessories\n- Use clear bins or boxes for seasonal items\n\n**4. Organize by Category and Color**\n- Group similar items together (shirts, pants, dresses)\n- Arrange by color within each category for easy finding\n- Place frequently worn items at eye level\n\n**5. Maintain the System**\n- Follow the \"one in, one out\" rule\n- Do a quick tidy-up weekly\n- Reassess seasonally to keep clutter at bay\n\n**Pro tip:** Store out-of-season clothes elsewhere to maximize space for current wardrobe items."

You should now have all corners nested together\n\n4. **Lay flat**: Place the sheet on a flat surface with the elastic edges forming one side. Straighten and smooth it into a rectangle\n\n5. **Final folds**: Fold the rectangle into thirds lengthwise, then fold in half or thirds widthwise until you have a compact square\n\n**Tip**: The key is nesting those elastic corners together first - once you have that, the rest is just regular folding!"

Ideally, you should have money left over.\n\n## 4. **Set Goals**\n- If you have surplus: allocate to savings, debt payoff, or investments\n- If you're short: identify areas to cut back\n\n## 5. **Track and Adjust**\nReview monthly and adjust as needed. Use apps, spreadsheets, or pen and paper\u2014whatever works for you.\n\n**Quick tip**: Try the 50/30/20 rule as a starting point: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/debt."

For example, \u221a16 = 4 because 4 \u00d7 4 = 16.\n\n## Methods to Calculate:\n\n### 1. **Using a Calculator**\n- Simply enter the number and press the \u221a button (most straightforward method)\n\n### 2. **Prime Factorization Method**\n- Break the number into prime factors\n- Group identical factors in pairs\n- Take one number from each pair\n- Example: \u221a36 = \u221a(2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73) = 2\u00d73 = 6\n\n### 3. **Estimation Method**\n- Find perfect squares closest to your number\n- Example: For \u221a50, note that \u221a49 = 7 and \u221a64 = 8, so \u221a50 \u2248 7.1\n\n### 4. **Long Division Method** (for precise manual calculation)\n- A systematic algorithm similar to long division that yields decimal places one at a time\n\nFor most practical purposes, using a calculator is the quickest and most accurate approach."

Then grab the fourth corner and fold it in too. You should now have all four corners nested together in one hand.\n\n4. **Lay flat and straighten**: Place the sheet on a flat surface with the elastic edges forming one side. Smooth out the fabric into a rectangular shape.\n\n5. **Fold into a rectangle**: Fold the sheet in thirds lengthwise, then in thirds or halves widthwise until you have a neat square or rectangle.\n\n**Pro tip**: It doesn't have to be perfect! Even a roughly folded fitted sheet that fits nicely in your linen closet is a win."

Using a Calculator**\nThe simplest method is using a calculator's \u221a button or square root function.\n\n## **2. Prime Factorization Method**\n- Break the number into prime factors\n- Pair identical factors\n- Take one number from each pair\n- Multiply them together\n\n*Example: \u221a36 = \u221a(2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73) = 2\u00d73 = 6*\n\n## **3. Long Division Method**\nA manual algorithm similar to long division that works digit by digit to find the square root.\n\n## **4. Estimation and Refinement**\n- Guess a number\n- Divide the original number by your guess\n- Average the result with your guess\n- Repeat until sufficiently accurate\n\n*Example for \u221a20:*\n- Guess 4 \u2192 20\u00f74 = 5 \u2192 Average: (4+5)/2 = 4.5\n- Try 4.5 \u2192 20\u00f74.5 \u2248 4.44 \u2192 Average: (4.5+4.44)/2 \u2248 4.47\n\n## **5. Using Exponents**\n\u221ax = x^(1/2) or x^0.5\n\nThe best method depends on whether you need an exact answer (perfect squares) or an approximation, and what tools you have available."

For example, \u221a16 = 4 because 4 \u00d7 4 = 16.\n\n## Methods to Calculate:\n\n### 1. **Using a Calculator**\nThe simplest method\u2014just enter the number and press the \u221a button.\n\n### 2. **Prime Factorization** (for perfect squares)\n- Break the number into prime factors\n- Pair identical factors\n- Multiply one number from each pair\n- Example: \u221a36 = \u221a(2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73) = 2\u00d73 = 6\n\n### 3. **Estimation Method**\n- Find two perfect squares the number falls between\n- Example: For \u221a50, since 49 < 50 < 64, then \u221a50 is between 7 and 8\n- Refine by testing values (\u221a50 \u2248 7.07)\n\n### 4. **Long Division Method** (manual calculation)\nA step-by-step algorithm similar to long division that gives precise decimal places\u2014useful before calculators existed.\n\nFor most practical purposes, using a calculator or estimation is sufficient!"

For example, \u221a16 = 4 because 4 \u00d7 4 = 16.\n\n## Methods to Calculate:\n\n**1. Perfect Squares (Memorization)**\n- Learn common perfect squares: \u221a1=1, \u221a4=2, \u221a9=3, \u221a16=4, \u221a25=5, etc.\n\n**2. Calculator**\n- Use the \u221a button on a calculator for quick results\n\n**3. Prime Factorization Method**\n- Break the number into prime factors\n- Pair identical factors and take one from each pair\n- Example: \u221a36 = \u221a(2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73) = 2\u00d73 = 6\n\n**4. Long Division Method** (for manual calculation)\n- A systematic algorithm similar to long division\n- Groups digits in pairs from the decimal point outward\n- Useful for non-perfect squares\n\n**5. Estimation Method**\n- Find two perfect squares the number falls between\n- Example: \u221a50 is between \u221a49 (7) and \u221a64 (8), so approximately 7.07\n\nFor most practical purposes, using a calculator is the fastest and most accurate method."

Prime Factorization Method**\n- Break the number into prime factors\n- Pair identical factors and take one from each pair\n- Example: \u221a36 = \u221a(2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73) = 2\u00d73 = 6\n\n**3. Long Division Method** (for manual calculation)\n- Group digits in pairs from the decimal point\n- Find the largest number whose square is less than the first group\n- Continue the process similar to long division\n\n**4. Estimation Method**\n- Find perfect squares closest to your number\n- Estimate between them\n- Example: \u221a50 is between \u221a49 (7) and \u221a64 (8), closer to 7\n\nFor most practical purposes, using a calculator or computer is recommended for accuracy."

Estimation Method:**\n- Find two perfect squares the number falls between (e.g., for \u221a50: 49 < 50 < 64, so \u221a50 is between 7 and 8)\n- Refine by testing decimals\n\n**3. Long Division Method (manual):**\n- Group digits in pairs from the decimal point\n- Find the largest digit whose square doesn't exceed the first group\n- Bring down pairs and repeat a division-like process\n\n**4. Babylonian Method (iterative approximation):**\n- Make an initial guess (x\u2080)\n- Apply formula: x_(n+1) = (x_n + N/x_n) / 2\n- Repeat until desired accuracy\n\n**Example:** \u221a50 using Babylonian method:\n- Guess: 7\n- (7 + 50/7) / 2 = 7.071...\n- Continue \u2192 7.071 (accurate to 3 decimals)\n\nFor most purposes, using a calculator is recommended!"

Insert the valve through the rim hole, then tuck the tube inside the tire all around.\n\n7. **Reseat the tire** - Push the tire bead back onto the rim with your hands, working away from the valve. Use tire levers only if necessary at the end.\n\n8. **Inflate** - Pump to the recommended pressure (printed on tire sidewall), then reinstall the wheel on your bike."

Let sit for 10 seconds, then gently push cooked edges toward center, tilting pan so uncooked egg flows to edges\n4. **Add fillings** - When eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top (about 1-2 minutes), add fillings to one half\n5. **Fold and serve** - Fold omelette in half, let cook 10 more seconds, then slide onto plate\n\n**Key tips:**\n- Don't overcook - the eggs should be creamy, not rubbery\n- Work quickly - the whole process takes 2-3 minutes\n- Medium heat is crucial - too hot and it browns too fast"

Let sit for 20 seconds, then gently push cooked edges toward center, tilting pan so uncooked egg flows to edges\n4. **Add fillings** - When eggs are mostly set but still slightly wet on top (about 2 minutes), add fillings to one half\n5. **Fold and serve** - Fold the omelette in half, let it cook 30 more seconds, then slide onto a plate\n\n**Key tips:**\n- Don't overcook - the omelette should be slightly creamy inside\n- Use medium heat to prevent browning\n- Work quickly once eggs hit the pan\n- A good non-stick pan makes all the difference"
